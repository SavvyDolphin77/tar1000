# tar1000
A bash script I made for untaring a tared archive with a lot of tar files inside.
Of course this will not work for all files due to how the program works. Because in my instance the tar file had been named 1000 to 1 all I needed to do was a  for loop and change name of tar based off number. If your files are not numbers, then this program will not work for untaring tar files within tar files to which I apologize

Also, for your convince there is a tar file that has been put in and tared 1000 times. Note, this file was from PicoCTF 2019 so still has the flag, which if you run this program you can get. But you can use that file to test this program to your hearts desire.

Programming Code is called tar1000.sh
Tar file for testing is called 1000.tar
